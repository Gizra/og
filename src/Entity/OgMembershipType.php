 * The membership type entity.

 * A membership type is the bundle of the OG membership. There is a single
 * "default" bundle that comes out of the box, but others can be created. The
 * use case for membership types, is for example creating a "premium"
 * membership.
 *
 * By having a different membership type, also different fields can be attached,
 * so in our "premium" membership, we could add a date field, to indicate when
 * the subscription should be ended.
