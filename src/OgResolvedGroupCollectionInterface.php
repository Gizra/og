/**
 * Interface for classes providing a collection of resolved groups.
 *
 * This is intended for holding the groups that are discovered by
 * OgGroupResolver plugins. When this class is instantiated it initially doesn't
 * hold any groups. It is then passed to each OgGroupResolver plugin which can
 * add groups to the collection, or remove groups from it. After the final
 * plugin has finished its work the resulting list of groups can be used to
 * determine the group context.
 *
 * This class also has some additional features that are intended to help with
 * determining the correct group context from a given collection of groups.
 * Several plugins might discover the same group inside their domain, so adding
 * a group multiple times by different plugins will increase the likelihood that
 * this group will be ultimately chosen. Each time a group is added in fact a
 * vote is cast in its favor. Each vote carries a certain weight. In normal
 * circumstances the weight will be determined by the plugin's priority and will
 * be set by calling ::setVoteWeight() before instantiating the plugin. A plugin
 * is free to override the vote weight if they consider a group they discovered
 * is particularly noteworthy.
 *
 * Plugins can also declare their search domain by passing along the cache
 * context IDs of the domain they operate in. This will ensure that the proper
 * cache contexts will be present on the group that is finally set as route
 * context.
 *
 * @todo Implement the passing of cache context IDs.
 *
 * See OgResolvedGroupCollection for the main implementation of this class,
 * OgContext::getRunTimeContext() for the main consumer of the collections, and
 * the various OgGroupResolver plugins for examples on how to add and remove
 * groups in a collection.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\og\ContextProvider\OgContext::getRuntimeContexts()
